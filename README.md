JSON HTTP Database API: Easily create, modify, and delete key-value pairs using HTTP GET requests.

API provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with a JSON-based database using HTTP GET requests. With our API, anyone can easily create, modify, and delete key-value pairs in the database.

To create a new entry, simply send a GET request with the desired key-value pair as parameters, and our API will automatically add it to the database. To modify an existing entry, just send a GET request with the updated value, and our API will update the corresponding key-value pair. And if you need to remove an entry, just send a GET request with the key you want to delete, and our API will take care of the rest.
